**Question:** Movie Recommendation to Watch BobbyLee 01/05/2024 08:11 AMI’ve been wanting to watch some movies for a while now. But I don't know where to start and what movies are good. I don’t usually watch movies a lot unless it has to do with a show I watch. I don’t care what genre is, when it was made, old or new. Do you have any suggestion?Jasmine 01/05/2024 08:26 AMI recommend 'Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret'. It's a beautiful movie, wonderful cast and heartfelt story that should resonate with everyone. Loved every second. It is a movie suitable for all ages.Sarah 01/05/2024 08:28 AMI can recommend you two best movies:1. Nicholas Sparks' The Notebook. It feels like you are reading a diary while watching this movie. I can say how detailed and wonderful this movie is. I cannot really give too much away about the story just watch it.2. The Godfather. It is A Must see. A favourite and one of the greatest movies of all times with incredible casts.Miranda 01/05/2024 08:29 AMI believe no one would recommend Pinocchio since it is a terrible movie in all aspect. The voices are just awful to listen - it so badly played, flat tones, so disconnected between the movie and what they say. No emotion. The graphics are also not great. It looks like one of the games from 10-15years ago. Overall, a low budget movie. The story just doesn’t add up the script and logic. My kids were bored too. I feel sad for the crew who has worked on this - it's so mediocre.Fred 01/05/2024 08:24 AMSkyfall is definitely the best James Bond movie since Goldfinger. Released in 2012 on the 50th anniversary of the very first Bond movie, Skyfall went on to score a billion dollars at the box office, two Oscars, and heaps of global adoration. Everything just clicked: the song, the villain, the action, the Bond, the M, the Q, the Moneypenny, the car, the locations, the cinematography all triumphs.Brian457 01/05/2024 08:20 AMArmageddon is such an underrated gem and it's such a great movie. The movie's got a great story. It had all genres, from drama, thriller, romance, and relief comedy. I must have seen this movie at least 30 times and I get something in my eye every time. Clearly it is one of my favourite movies of all time. I love the acting, the emotion, the humour and the characters. A classic apocalyptic disaster movie without equal and definitely worth-watching.Adapted from   https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1b7od2v/movie_recommendations/

**Question:** Text 2A       UNAIDS warns that gaps in HIV prevention are driving new HIV infections in the Indian Ocean Countries (IOC) and several other countries in Africa. The critical gaps in HIV prevention were the focus of a workshop organized by UNAIDS and UNFPA which was hosted in Madagascar to address some of the barriers to accelerating progress.       Insufficient focus on HIV prevention in a number of African countries including Egypt, Madagascar, Angola, Sudan and South Sudan has resulted in these countries not achieving the proportionate declines in new infections seen in the rest of the region.       The increase in the number of new infections in a country like Madagascar for example, is in stark contrast to the downward trend in Botswana which has seen a 66% decline in new HIV infections since 2010 and 36% decline in AIDS-related deaths during the same period.  As a result, Botswana—along with Eswatini, Rwanda and Zimbabwe— are on the path to end AIDS through strong HIV prevention and treatment interventions.Adapted from https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/pressreleaseandstatementarchive/2024 Text 2B       The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) targets cells in the immune system – the body’s defence against illness – and weakens the body’s ability to fight against infections and some types of cancer. The virus destroys white blood cells in the immune system called CD4 cells and replicates itself inside these cells.       As the virus destroys and impairs the function of immune cells, infected individuals gradually become immunodeficient. The body becomes increasingly unable to fight infections and disease and vulnerable to opportunistic infections and cancers.  Immune function is typically measured by CD4 cell count. The most advanced stage of HIV infection is acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), which can take from two to 15 years to develop, depending on the individual.       No effective cure for HIV exists at present but it can be suppressed by a combination of medicines called antiretroviral (ARV) therapy consisting of three or more ARV drugs. Antiretroviral therapy does not cure HIV infection but suppresses viral replication within a person's body and allows an individual's immune system to strengthen and regain the capacity to fight off infections.Adapted from https://www.afro.who.int/health-topics/hivaids

The most advanced stage of HIV infection is acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), which can take from two to 15 years to develop, depending on the individual.       No effective cure for HIV exists at present but it can be suppressed by a combination of medicines called antiretroviral (ARV) therapy consisting of three or more ARV drugs. Antiretroviral therapy does not cure HIV infection but suppresses viral replication within a person's body and allows an individual's immune system to strengthen and regain the capacity to fight off infections.Adapted from https://www.afro.who.int/health-topics/hivaids


**Soal:** The author’s idea of the relationship between insufficient of HIV prevention and the increasing of HIV infection is analogous with

**Question:** Text 2A       UNAIDS warns that gaps in HIV prevention are driving new HIV infections in the Indian Ocean Countries (IOC) and several other countries in Africa. The critical gaps in HIV prevention were the focus of a workshop organized by UNAIDS and UNFPA which was hosted in Madagascar to address some of the barriers to accelerating progress.       Insufficient focus on HIV prevention in a number of African countries including Egypt, Madagascar, Angola, Sudan and South Sudan has resulted in these countries not achieving the proportionate declines in new infections seen in the rest of the region.       The increase in the number of new infections in a country like Madagascar for example, is in stark contrast to the downward trend in Botswana which has seen a 66% decline in new HIV infections since 2010 and 36% decline in AIDS-related deaths during the same period.  As a result, Botswana—along with Eswatini, Rwanda and Zimbabwe— are on the path to end AIDS through strong HIV prevention and treatment interventions.Adapted from https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/pressreleaseandstatementarchive/2024 Text 2B       The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) targets cells in the immune system – the body’s defence against illness – and weakens the body’s ability to fight against infections and some types of cancer.

**Question:** TEXT 3A       A comic book convention (one-day event) or comic con is a fan convention with a primary focus on comic books and comic book culture, in which comic book fans gather to meet creators, experts, and each other. Commonly, comic conventions are multi-day events hosted at convention centers, hotels, or college campuses. They feature a wide variety of activities and panels, with a larger number of attendees participating in cosplay than most other types of fan conventions. Comic book conventions are also used as a vehicle for industry, in which publishers, distributors, and retailers represent their comic-related releases.        Comic-cons were traditionally organized by fans on a non profit basis, though nowadays most events catering to fans are run by commercial interests for profit. At commercial events, comic book creators often give out autographs to the fans, sometimes in exchange for a flat appearance fee, and sometimes may draw illustrations for a per-item fee.        The first official comic book convention was held in 1964 in New York City and was called New York Comicon. The first recurring conventions were the Detroit Triple Fan Fair, which ran from 1965 to 1978, and Academy Con, which ran from 1965 to 1967. San Diego Comic-Con International, a multigenre entertainment and comic convention held annually in San Diego since 1970, is the standard bearer for U.S. comic-cons. According to Forbes, the convention is the “largest convention of its kind in the world”, and is also the largest convention held in San Diego.Adated from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book_convention TEXT 3B       Cosplay or costume play is an activity and performance art in which participants called cosplayers wear costumes and fashion accessories to represent a specific character. Cosplayers often interact to create a subculture, and a broader use of the term "cosplay" applies to any costumed role-playing in venues apart from the stage. Favorite sources include anime, cartoons, comic books, manga, television series, rock music performances, video games and in some cases, original characters. The term is composed of the two aforementioned counterparts – costume and role play.       A rapid growth in the number of people cosplaying as a hobby since the 1990s has made the phenomenon a significant aspect of popular culture in Japan, as well as in other parts of East Asia and in the Western world. Cosplay events are common features of fan conventions, and today there are many dedicated conventions and competitions, as well as social networks, websites, and other forms of media centered on cosplay activities. Cosplay is very popular among all genders and ages as it poses many benefits as instill creativity.        For children, dressing up in costumes can encourage them to think outside of the box and come up with new and imaginative scenarios. Whether they're playing superheroes, princesses, or characters from their favorite movies or books, children are given the chance to explore different worlds and create their own unique stories. In addition, costumes can also foster social and emotional development in them.
