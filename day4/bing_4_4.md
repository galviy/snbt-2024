**Question:** Teks 2A       President Obama recognizes that technology is an essential ingredient of economic growth and job creation. Ensuring America has 21st century digital infrastructure, such as high-speed broadband Internet access, fourth-generation (4.0) wireless networks, new health care information technology and a modernized electrical grid, is critical to our long-term prosperity and competitiveness.       The President is committed to ensuring America has a thriving and growing Internet economy. The Internet has become a global platform for communication, commerce and individual expression, and now promises to support breakthroughs in important national priorities such as health care, education and energy. Additionally, the Internet and information technology can be applied to make government more effective, transparent and accessible to all Americans.Adapted from www.whitehouse.gov Text 2B       President Obama has committed to making high-speed wireless services available to at least 98 percent of Americans. The availability of new wireless broadband services will allow more Americans to use the internet to learn, work and play regardless of where they live.

**Question:** Text 3       A huge study, published this summer in the British Medical Journal, seemed to indicate that a diet filled with spices – including chilies – was beneficial for health. A team at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences tracked the health of nearly half a million participants in China for several years. They found that participants who said they ate spicy food once or twice a week had a mortality rate 10% lower than those who ate spicy food less than once a week. Risk of death reduced still further for hot-heads who ate spicy food six or seven days a week.       Chili peppers were the most commonly used spice among the sample, and those who ate fresh chili had a lower risk of death from cancer, coronary heart disease and diabetes. One of the authors of the study, Lu Qi – who confesses that he is very keen on spicy food – says there are likely to be many reasons for this effect. “The data encourages people to eat more spicy food to improve health and reduce mortality risk at an early age,” says Qi, a nutritionist at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health.       While the health-promoting properties of chilies may not be fully understood, at least we have a good idea where to look to find the source of them. Cut a chili open and you will see yellow placenta-like fronds that attach the seeds to the inside of the fruit. In most types of chili, this is the location of the spice’s secret weapon - capsaicin. It is capsaicin that makes chilies hot. The heat is measured in Scoville heat units, which is the number of times a sample of dissolved dried chili must be diluted by its own weight in sugar water before it loses its heat. For a green bell pepper this is zero. However, the Aztec codices also tell us that they put chili on their teeth to kill toothache pain, and the use of capsaicin as an analgesic also continues to this day.       Several studies have also indicated that capsaicin has powerful anti-cancer properties. It has been found to be helpful in fighting human prostate and lung cancer cells in mice, and there are also indications that it could be used as a treatment for colon cancer. It may also improve drug resistance for bile-duct cancer sufferers. Capsaicin creams and patches are available in chemists to ease pain. But it’s only in the past 20 years that we have come to understand the contradiction of how something that causes pain can ease it too. Capsaicin binds to the pain receptor TRPV1, which our brains also use to detect changes in temperature – that’s why we think chilies are hot.Adapted from https://www.bbc.com

**Question:** Text 4       Children given more fast food meals will grow up to have a lower IQ than those who regularly eat freshly-cooked meals, according to a study.        Childhood nutrition has long lasting effects on IQ, even after previous intelligence and wealth and social status are taken into account, it found. The study examined whether the type of main meal that children ate each day had an impact on their cognitive ability and growth.       It looked at 4,000 Scottish children aged three to five years old and compared fast food with freshly-cooked food. The study, undertaken by an academic at Goldsmiths, University of London, found that parents with a higher socio-economic status reported that they gave their children meals prepared with fresh ingredients more often, which positively affected their IQ.       Lower socio-economic status was linked to more children having fast food, which led to lower intelligence. Dr. Sophie von Stumm, from the department of psychology at Goldsmiths, said "It is common sense that the type of food we eat will affect brain development, but previous research has only looked at the effects of specific food groups on children's IQ rather than at generic types of meals.       (1.) She said her findings highlighted that differences in children's meals were also a social problem. (2) "Mothers and fathers from less privileged backgrounds often have less time to prepare a freshly cooked meal from scratch for their children," Dr Stumm said. (3) "These children score lower on intelligence tests and often struggle in school. (4) It eventually gives them an opportunity to demonstrate their ability at school. (5) It shows that the freshness and quality of food matters more than just being full, in particular when children are young," she added.       Similar discoveries were made in an Australian study published in August. It found that toddlers on a diet of drinks and sweets were less bright as they got older. By the age of eight, the 'junk food' children had IQs up to two points lower than their healthy counterparts, according to the researchers from the University of Adelaide. The researchers suspected that the negative effect of eating junk food so early in life may not be altered by future healthy habits because brain development is hinderedAdapted from https://www.thedailystar.net/

**Question:** Text 4       Children given more fast food meals will grow up to have a lower IQ than those who regularly eat freshly-cooked meals, according to a study.        Childhood nutrition has long lasting effects on IQ, even after previous intelligence and wealth and social status are taken into account, it found. The study examined whether the type of main meal that children ate each day had an impact on their cognitive ability and growth.       It looked at 4,000 Scottish children aged three to five years old and compared fast food with freshly-cooked food. The study, undertaken by an academic at Goldsmiths, University of London, found that parents with a higher socio-economic status reported that they gave their children meals prepared with fresh ingredients more often, which positively affected their IQ.       Lower socio-economic status was linked to more children having fast food, which led to lower intelligence. Dr. Sophie von Stumm, from the department of psychology at Goldsmiths, said "It is common sense that the type of food we eat will affect brain development, but previous research has only looked at the effects of specific food groups on children's IQ rather than at generic types of meals.       (1.) She said her findings highlighted that differences in children's meals were also a social problem. (2) "Mothers and fathers from less privileged backgrounds often have less time to prepare a freshly cooked meal from scratch for their children," Dr Stumm said. (3) "These children score lower on intelligence tests and often struggle in school. (4) It eventually gives them an opportunity to demonstrate their ability at school. (5) It shows that the freshness and quality of food matters more than just being full, in particular when children are young," she added.       Similar discoveries were made in an Australian study published in August. It found that toddlers on a diet of drinks and sweets were less bright as they got older. By the age of eight, the 'junk food' children had IQs up to two points lower than their healthy counterparts, according to the researchers from the University of Adelaide.
