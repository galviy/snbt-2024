**Question:** Text 2A        Lavandula, common name lavender, is a genus of 47 known species of ﬂowering plants in the mint family, Lamiaceae. It is native to the Old World and is found in Cape Verde and the Canary Islands, and from Europe across to northern and eastern Africa, the Mediterranean, southwest Asia to India. Many members of the genus are cultivated extensively in temperate climates as ornamental plants for garden and landscape use, for use as culinary herbs, and also commercially for the extraction of essential oils. The most widely cultivated species, Lavandula angustifolia, is often referred to as lavender, and there is a color named for the shade of the ﬂowers of this species. Lavender has been used over centuries in traditional medicine and cosmetics.       The genus includes annual or short-lived herbaceous perennial plants, and shrub-like perennials, subshrubs or small shrubs. Leaf shape is diverse across the genus. They are simple in some commonly cultivated species. In other species, they are pinnately toothed, or pinnate, sometimes multiple pinnate and dissected. In most species, the leaves are covered in fine hairs or indumentum, which normally contain essential oils. Flowers are contained in whorls, held on spikes rising above the foliage, the spikes being branched in some species. Some species produce colored bracts at the tips of the inﬂorescences. The ﬂowers may be blue, violet, or lilac in the wild species, occasionally blackish purple or yellowish.       Lavenders ﬂourish best in dry, well-drained, sandy, or gravelly soils in full sun. English lavender has a long germination process (14–28 days) and matures within 100–110 days. All types need little or no fertilizer and good air circulation. In areas of high humidity, root rot due to fungus infection can be a problem. Organic mulches can trap moisture around the plants' bases, encouraging root rot. Gravelly materials such as crushed rocks give better results. It grows best in soils with a pH between 6 and 8. Most lavender is hand- harvested and harvest times vary depending on intended use.Adapted from https://en.wikipedia.org /wiki/Lavandula_angustifolia Text 2B       Lavender is an herb native to northern Africa and the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean. Lavender is also grown for the production of its essential oil, which comes from the distillation of the ﬂower spikes of certain lavender species. The oil has cosmetic uses, and it is believed to have some medicinal uses. Lavender essential oil, in contrast to the plant form, is toxic when swallowed. The herb is highly regarded for skin and beauty and is commonly used in fragrances and shampoos to help purify the skin. It can be purchased over-the- counter (OTC) from drugstores, and some versions are used to add ﬂavor to baked goods and foods.       There are also many medicinal properties associated with lavender. Lavender oil is believed to have antiseptic and anti- inﬂammatory properties, which can help to heal minor burns and bug bites. Research suggests that it may be useful for treating anxiety, insomnia, depression, and restlessness. Some studies suggest that consuming lavender as a tea can help digestive issues such as vomiting, nausea, intestinal gas, upset stomach, and abdominal swelling. In addition to helping with digestive problems, lavender is used to help relieve pain from headaches, sprains, toothaches, and sores. It can also be used to prevent hair loss. A study published in the Journal of Medical Microbiology found that lavender oil could be eﬀective in combating antifungal-resistant infections.       The researchers found that the oil was lethal to a range of strains that can cause disease in the skin. In the study, the essential oils distilled from the Lavandula genus of the lavender plant seemed to work by destroying the membranes of fungal cells. The study showed that Lavandula oil is potent and demonstrates antifungal activity on a wide spectrum. Lavender is possibly eﬀective for treating alopecia areata, a condition in which hair is lost from some or all areas of the body.Adapted from https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles /26592

**Question:** Text 3       A vaccine works by training the immune system to recognize and combat pathogens, either viruses or bacteria. To do this, certain molecules from the pathogen must be introduced into the body to trigger an immune response. These molecules are called antigens, and they are present on all viruses and bacteria. By injecting these antigens into the body, the immune system can safely learn to recognize them as hostile invaders, produce antibodies, and remember them for the future. If the bacteria or virus reappears, the immune system will recognize the antigens immediately and attack aggressively well before the pathogen can spread and cause sickness.       Vaccines don't just work on an individual level, they protect entire populations. Once enough people are immunized, opportunities for an outbreak of disease become so low even people who aren't immunized benefit. Essentially, a bacteria or virus simply won't have enough eligible hosts to establish a foothold and will eventually die out entirely. This phenomenon is called "herd immunity" or "community immunity," and it has allowed once-devastating diseases to be eliminated entirely, without needing to vaccinate every individual. This is critical because there will always be a percentage of the population that cannot be vaccinated, including infants, young children, the elderly people with severe allergies, pregnant women, or people with compromised immune systems. Thanks to herd immunity, these people are kept safe because diseases are never given a chance to spread through a population.       Public health officials and scientists continue to study herd immunity and identify key thresholds, but one telling example is the country of Gambia, where a vaccination rate of just 70% of the population was enough to eliminate Hib disease entirely. However, if too many people forgo vaccinations, herd immunity can break down, opening up the population to the risk of outbreaks. That is why many officials and doctors consider widespread immunization a public health imperative and blame recent disease outbreaks on a lack of vaccination. Doctors and paramedics work hard in treating the patients of HIV positive.        For example, in 1997, prominent medical journal The Lancet published research claiming to have found a link between the measles vaccine and autism. As a result, in following years the parents of over a million British children decided not to vaccinate their kids. The research has since been thoroughly debunked, but the number of measles cases has skyrocketed, from just several dozen a year in 1997 to over 2,000 cases in 2011. Similar outbreaks have occurred throughout the United States, involving both measles and whooping cough, with doctors and officials blaming low rates of vaccination.Adapted from https://www.publichealth.org/public-awareness/understanding-vaccines/vaccines-work/

This is critical because there will always be a percentage of the population that cannot be vaccinated, including infants, young children, the elderly people with severe allergies, pregnant women, or people with compromised immune systems. Thanks to herd immunity, these people are kept safe because diseases are never given a chance to spread through a population.       Public health officials and scientists continue to study herd immunity and identify key thresholds, but one telling example is the country of Gambia, where a vaccination rate of just 70% of the population was enough to eliminate Hib disease entirely. However, if too many people forgo vaccinations, herd immunity can break down, opening up the population to the risk of outbreaks. That is why many officials and doctors consider widespread immunization a public health imperative and blame recent disease outbreaks on a lack of vaccination. Doctors and paramedics work hard in treating the patients of HIV positive.        For example, in 1997, prominent medical journal The Lancet published research claiming to have found a link between the measles vaccine and autism. As a result, in following years the parents of over a million British children decided not to vaccinate their kids. The research has since been thoroughly debunked, but the number of measles cases has skyrocketed, from just several dozen a year in 1997 to over 2,000 cases in 2011. Similar outbreaks have occurred throughout the United States, involving both measles and whooping cough, with doctors and officials blaming low rates of vaccination.Adapted from https://www.publichealth.org/public-awareness/understanding-vaccines/vaccines-work/

**Question:** Text 3       A vaccine works by training the immune system to recognize and combat pathogens, either viruses or bacteria. To do this, certain molecules from the pathogen must be introduced into the body to trigger an immune response. These molecules are called antigens, and they are present on all viruses and bacteria. By injecting these antigens into the body, the immune system can safely learn to recognize them as hostile invaders, produce antibodies, and remember them for the future. If the bacteria or virus reappears, the immune system will recognize the antigens immediately and attack aggressively well before the pathogen can spread and cause sickness.       Vaccines don't just work on an individual level, they protect entire populations. Once enough people are immunized, opportunities for an outbreak of disease become so low even people who aren't immunized benefit. Essentially, a bacteria or virus simply won't have enough eligible hosts to establish a foothold and will eventually die out entirely. This phenomenon is called "herd immunity" or "community immunity," and it has allowed once-devastating diseases to be eliminated entirely, without needing to vaccinate every individual.

**Question:** Text 4       The very idea that an image or a sculpture represents something other than itself has often been interpreted by orthodox Muslims as irreconcilable with the central message in Islam: “There is no god but God.” For this reason, one could say that all art made in the Islamic world may be considered devoid of symbolism. But if we look at actual works, we can see that several motifs in Islamic art can easily be related to symbols of both recent and earlier date.        Muslim rulers in Islam’s first centuries inherited a rich imagery with a large number of symbolic motifs. Paradisiacal and princely motifs, signs of the zodiac, mythical creatures, and religious images could be found in virtually all parts of the new empire, especially in the west. Reused in an Islamic context, however, the question is whether most of these symbols did not in fact quickly lose their original significance. Lions, gazelles, griffins, harpies, and sphinxes appear haphazardly on all manner of objects. Dragons and phoenixes are sometimes good, sometimes evil, and sometimes purely decorative.       Princely symbolism, in particular, seems to have undergone a transformation from being highly significant to being primarily decorative. A classical princely symbol like the lion or the falcon attacking a weaker animal (signifying the prince’s right to rule) can be found both on costly objects and on quite commonplace every day ware.       In recent times, the crescent moon has taken on a special status as a kind of unifying symbol for everything Islamic. But one should not consider the crescent moon as a proper symbol comparable to the Christian cross. In reality, what has most often been used in the Muslim world as a symbol of Islam is the Arabic script.Adapted from https://www.davidmus.dk/en/collections/islamic/cultural-history-themes/symbolism
